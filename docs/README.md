We created a vuepress theme to facilitate the maintenance of the documentation for Vue-a11y, it is a work in progress, but it is available for anyone who wants to use and contribute.

It does not replace the default vuepress theme, however, this theme contains most Vue-a11y packages and some plugins to improve semantics and accessibility in the documentation.

## Packages included

- [vue-skip-to](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-skip-to)
- [@vue-a11y/dark-mode](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-dark-mode)
- [@vue-a11y/announcer](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-announcer)
